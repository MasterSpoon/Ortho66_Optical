 Ortho 66 Optical PCB using KeyChron low profile optical switches
 
A member on Optical Future discord did trial fit of ir12-21 on switch and will be too close to use.
Took some measurements from a photo I found of a KeyChron PCB and appears they are using 0603 side view IR & PT
Managed to locate some and will need to redo PCB to suit.
Datasheets updated in resources.

This keyboard PCB is a work in progress and has been uploaded to share progress. Schmatic the PCB should be complete however the PCB will need to be updated with the new footprints for 0603 side IR and PT

The footprint's have not yet been tested and will likely be too close to fit correctly.
The code to support the matrix in QMK has not yet been written.
The MCU's are quite hard to obtain at the moment.
Feel free to do with it what you want but I would not suggest getting a PCB made based on the current version.

If you plan to use the footprints in an alternate design there are scripts under the resource folder that will place the supporting components in what I think should be the correct position. Look at the existing schematic for how each part should be named or you can also look at the scripts to get an idea on how they work.
