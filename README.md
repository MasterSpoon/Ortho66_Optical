# Ortho66_Optical
 Ortho 66 Optical PCB using KeyChron low profile optical switches

This keyboard PCB is a work in progress and has been uploaded to share progress. Electrically the PCB should be complete with the only pending change to the mounting holes. It has not yet been prototyped so may contain errors.

The footprint's have not yet been tested.
The code to support the matrix in QMK has not yet been written.
The MCU's are quite hard to obtain at the moment.
Feel free to do with it what you want, if you do make a PCB using the footprints or get these made please let me know how the footpirnts worked out.

If you plan to use the footprints in an alternate design there are scripts under the resource folder that will place the supporting components in what I think should be the correct position. Look at the existing schematic for how each part should be named or you can also look at the scripts to get an idea on how they work.
